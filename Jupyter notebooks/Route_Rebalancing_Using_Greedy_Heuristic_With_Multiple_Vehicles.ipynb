    "# A Greedy Heuristic for routing assignment \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the [Minimum Cost Flow Problem](/Jupyter%20notebooks/Inventory_Rebalancing_With_Minimum_Cost_Flow.ipynb) we have defined exhanges between supply and demand nodes in such a way that the net demand at each bikestations returns to 0 at the end of a given day. These exchanges are at an approximated minimum value. We now want to assign vehicles to traverse the network of bikestations to carry out these exchanges. We took a look at doing this using a [network transformation and google OR-tools](/Jupyter%20notebooks/Route_Rebalancing_Using_TSP_and_Google_ORtools.ipynb). The approach had limitations and couldn't be extended to multiple vehicles. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead we will now introduce a greedy heuristic method for approximating the minimum cost route on our bipartite network which performs all the necessary exchanges for returning the demand in the  network to its original state. The solution to this problem will be useful for the bike station companies who are looking to send vehicles out to rebalance the bike stations at a low cost. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Greedy Heuristic \n",
    "\n",
    "We want a way of traversing the network so that all of the demand is satisfied at an approximated minimum cost. Consider the case of one vehicle starting at a supply node. There are one or more 'exchange' edges to demand nodes from that supply node that it can take. These 'exchange' edges are what we calculated using the minimum cost flow problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "So the vehicle at the supply node can travel along the shortest available exchange edge, or nearest demand node that is served from that supply node. It can make a note that this edge has been traversed and if all the exchange edges have been traversed it marks the given supply node as satisfied. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now the vehicle is at a demand node. It can calculate the nearest unsatisfied supply node and return to it. It then repeats the process until all of the supply nodes are satsified. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the basis for our greedy heursitic, we track the unsatisfied supply nodes and traverse continue moving to the nearest edges until the problem all the supply nodes are satisfied. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is easily extendable to multiple vehicles. We simply set a maximum distance that a vehcile can travel and stop the algorithm for the vehicle once it has reached its maximum travel distance. We then start the algorithm for a new vehicle from a random supply node with the left over unsatisfied supply nodes. \n"
